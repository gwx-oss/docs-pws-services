<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> SSL (HTTPS) does not work with custom domains without the use of third-party SSL termination. Pivotal recommends using CloudFlare for this service. </p>

This topic explains how to set up an SSL-enabled custom domain using CloudFlare,
a content distribution network.
This is the Pivotal-recommended strategy for using SSL with a custom domain.
Using this configuration, traffic to and from your application running on Cloud
Foundry is routed through CloudFlare.

Browser  &lt; &mdash; ssl &mdash; &gt;  CloudFlare proxy  &lt; &mdash; ssl &mdash; &gt;  Cloud Foundry

To enable this, you configure CloudFlare's **Full SSL** option for the domain.
You can use either a CloudFlare-generated SSL certificate between the browser and the
CloudFlare server, or configure CloudFlare to use a certificate that you provide.
A Cloud Foundry-generated SSL certificate is used between the CloudFlare proxy
and the application on Cloud Foundry.


## <a id='introduction'></a>What is CloudFlare?
CloudFlare is a caching and security-as-a-service provider that protects
and accelerates online websites.
Web traffic is routed through CloudFlare's global network.
This accelerates delivery of static and dynamic content,
while blocking threats and limiting abusive bots and crawlers from wasting
your bandwidth and server resources.

CloudFlare's SSL termination proxy decrypts incoming SSL traffic and can pass on
unencrypted or fully encrypted requests to the app server.
Adding your website requires changes to your domain's DNS settings.
SSL Termination is available with any of the CloudFlare plans, including the
Free plan. 


## <a id='prerequisite'></a>Prerequisites
To proceed with setting up your custom domains to be SSL-Enabled using CloudFlare,
this procedure requires the following:

* Your domain must be registered with a DNS registrar.
To complete this procedure, you must be able to access the DNS registrar for the
domain.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to change DNS registrars. The only change you make with your registrar is to point the authoritative nameservers to CloudFlare's nameservers. </p>

* You must have a CloudFlare account.
If you do not have one, you can sign up for one at [https://www.cloudflare.com/plans](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans).

* (Optional) You may download the zone file for the domain from your DNS provider prior to beginning,
as you will need to use it in [Configure DNS Records](#dns-records).


## <a id='add-domain'></a>Add Domain to CloudFlare
1. On the **Add your site** page, enter the name of your custom domain and
click **Add Site**.
CloudFlare queries authoritative DNS servers for the DNS record registered
for the domain.

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/add-website.png") %>

1. After you add your site, the following page is shown:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/scan-complete.png") %>

    Click **Next**.

1. Select a plan for your domain:
    * Choose **Free** or **Pro** to have CloudFlare generate an SSL
    certificate for communications between browsers and the CloudFlare proxy.
    * Choose **Business** if you prefer to provide your own SSL certificate.

## <a id='dns-records'></a>Configure DNS Records
The **DNS query results** page lists the records obtained from the
authoritative DNS servers for your domain.

1. Verify that in the row containing your domain name, 
that the cloud icon in the **Status** column is orange:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/configure-dns.png") %>

1. (Optional) To ensure your DNS records are correct and complete,
    download the zone file for the domain from your DNS provider,
    and then upload it to CloudFlare using the **Upload a DNS File** link under the **Advanced** dropdown.

1. Use the **Add Record** button to define additional records such as `CNAME` if necessary.
    
    For more information on using custom domains with PWS hosted apps, see [Using Custom Domain Names With Pivotal Web Services](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Using-Custom-Domain-Names-With-Pivotal-Web-Services) in the Pivotal Support knowledge base..

1. Click **Continue**.


## <a id='update-names'></a>Update Nameservers
The **Change your Nameservers** page lists your current nameservers and the CloudFlare
nameservers to replace them with.

1. Use the provided URLs to update the nameserver settings for your domain with
the authoritative server for your domain, such as your ISP.

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/update-name.png") %>

1. Click **Continue**.


## <a id='select-ssl'></a> Verify Crypto Settings

1. Select the **Crypto** tab from the top navigation bar:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/nav-crypto.png") %>

1. Verify that **Full SSL** is selected as your SSL setting:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/choose-ssl.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Off</strong> and <strong>Flexible</strong> are not secure, and <strong>Full SSL (Strict)</strong> does not work with PWS, so you must use <strong>Full SSL</strong>.

1. Scroll down and verify that **Always Use HTTPS** is set to **On**:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/use-https.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Because DNS settings are cached in various points throughout the Internet, including on your browser, changes to these SSL settings may take some time to propagate through the system and start functioning as you would expect.</p>


## <a id='review'></a>Review Pending Changes
After your initial domain setup is complete, review any pending changes required by CloudFlare. To do this, do the following:

1. Click the **Overview** tab from the top navigation bar.

1. Review any pending actions required, such as completing your nameserver setup:

    <%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/overview-complete-setup.png") %>

Once all pending actions are completed, the status of your Domain will change from **Pending** to **Active**, for example:

<%= image_tag("../../images/cloudflare/domain-overview-dropdown.png") %>

Once your registrar has processed your nameserver changes, and your site becomes active on Cloudflare, you will begin to receive analytics on your traffic:
